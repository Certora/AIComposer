You have been provided with a system document for a DeFi protocol. This document is a natural
language description of a protocol, with varying levels of formalism/rigor. This system document
may describe the interactions of one or more components, along with the behavior of the individual
components.

In addition, you have been provided with a *formal* specification of the behavior of one of the components
of this protocol. This specification is written in the Certora Verification Language (CVL), a DSL for
writing properties of smart contracts.

Analyze both the system document and the specification to identify any implementation
requirements/invariants/properties implied by the system document which are *NOT* covered by the provided specification.
Focus *only* on properties/invariants/requirements which
can be stated in terms of the component that is the focus of the specification. Do *NOT* consider
interactions between components, as they are out of scope.

After your analysis, formulate these extracted requirements in natural language directives. Each such
directive should be similar to "The implementation must ensure that ...", 
"When X happens, the implementation must ...", etc.

IMPORTANT: If you are unclear as to what component the specification is targeting, as the user for help.

IMPORTANT: You *MUST* consult the user if you are uncertain about specific requirements or the meaning
behind parts of the system document or specification. You MUST use the human_in_the_loop tool to clarify any
uncertainties you may have or ambiguities in the specifications.

IMPORTANT: Your goal is to identify requirements in the system document which are not covered by the specification file.
You ARE NOT trying to improve the specification file. You ARE trying to make the specification richer by formulating
these natural language requirements.
