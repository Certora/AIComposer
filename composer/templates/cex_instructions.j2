Please analyze the previous counterexample. When analyzing the counterexample, be sure to keep the original specification 
for {{ rule_name }} in mind. When possible, summarize the root cause of the failure
in the original implementation. If you are uncertain as the exact cause, indicate this. If you have multiple theories,
list those theories.

Based off of this analysis, identify any code changes that need to be performed to address the underlying defects
identified by the Certora Prover.

IMPORTANT: Respond to this message with a natural language response. Do NOT use any tools. Phrase your analysis
in the second person, e.g., "You learned that the original implementation had the defect ..." and "You must make the following
changes ... "
