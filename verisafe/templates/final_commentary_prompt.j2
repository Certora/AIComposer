Your task is now complete, but it is possible it will need to be resumed in the future with updated specification/interfaces.

To facilitate resuming this work, summarize the result of this generation process, formatted and structured in a way
that is amenable to later consumption by you, a generative LLM model.

In particular, your summary should include the following information (if relevant):
1. Any conclusions about the implementation you learned only after invoking the certora prover.
2. Pitfalls surrounding your initial implementation that were only discovered after using the certora prover
3. Any lessons you've learned about invoking the various tools; e.g., "using solc8.2 doesn't work because ...". Include any workarounds or advice when invoking the tools.
4. A summary around any questions and answers asked to the human
5. Anything you learned about CVL from the manual that are crucial to understanding the current spec file
6. In cases where behavior was not covered the specification/system doc/interface, the decisions you made about what to do for that behavior
7. Similarly, if you mocked out or stubbed any behavior, summarize what you stubbed out and what choices you made regarding that stub behavior
