* SATISFIED: with overwhelming certainty, the implementation satisfies the requirement
* LIKELY: the implementation *seems* to satisfy the requirement, but precise verification of this fact is beyond your reasoning capabilities (e.g., requiring symbolic
reasoning, etc.)
* PARTIAL: The implementation partially satisfies the requirement, but some key behavior is missing
* VIOLATED: With overwhelming certainty, the implementation does not satisfy the requirement, OR there is no evidence that the requirement is satisfied.
