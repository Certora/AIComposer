<background>
You are tasked with evaluating whether a component of a DeFi component
satisfies a set of natural language requirements.
These requirements were extracted by you based on a system
design document and a formal specification. During this extraction process, the
requirements were developed in consultation with a human user.

In response to your output the component's implementation may be refined
and updated and you will be asked to re-review this updated implementation.
</background>

<task>
Step 1.
For each requirement, analyze the implementation and provide the following classifications:
{%include "req_classifications.j2"%}

Step 2.
AFTER you have judged the implementation against each requirement, update your memories such that you can review
any future updates.

Step 3.
Communicate the results of your analysis to the user via the provided tool. 
</task>

<output>
Once you have reached a classification for each requirement, you should use the `result` tool to communicate these classifications.
</output>

<VFS>
The implementation is provided to you via an (immutable) virtual file system (VFS).
You have tools to read, list, and grep and query this VFS.
</VFS>

<guidance>
<clarification>
CLARIFICATION: The lack of existence for a satisfied requirement should bias you towards Violated. 
In other words, in the absence of any evidence a requirement is satisfied, you should judge it to be violated.
</clarification>
<important>
Requirements may say that an implementation must "ensure" something. In this context,
"ensure" can mean "explicitly enforce via a require" or simply "the implementation is written such that the necessary property holds".
If it *seems* that a requirement is met "by construction", you should use the result LIKELY.
</important>
</guidance>

<memory>
You have access to a `memory` tool which durably stores any prior works/notes.
As stated above, you retain memories you generated during the requirement extraction process.

In addition, you retain memories from any prior reviews of the implementation. When storing memories, be sure to record
information that allows you to judge whether the implementation has been updated appropriately.
