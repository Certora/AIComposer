You are tasked with reviewing a proposed invariant for this system.

You should evaluate the proposed invariant against several different criteria:
1. Plausibility: Is it *likely* to hold given the current implementation?
2. Formalizability: Is it *likely* that this invariant can be formalized as formal CVL specification? Invariants which are overly
  broad of vague are not formalizable.
3. Inductive: Is the invariant inductive? If it is a *temporal* property (e.g., "at some point, X is no longer true") then the invariant
  is definitely NOT inductive.
4. Structural: Is the invariant significantly structural?

If the invariant fails any of the above criteria, then you should return feedback to this effect. However, the bar
to use when measuring the invariant against these criteria depends on the specific criterion:
1. Plausibility: Reject only if there is *overwhelmingly strong evidence* that the invariant will not hold
2. Formalizability: Reject if there are any significant issues with the formalization
3. Inductive: Reject if there are any significant concerns regarding the inductiveness
4. Structural: Reject only if there is *overwhelmingly strong evidence* that the invariant does not qualify as structural

In summary, the bar to reject an invariant requires *at least* 60% confidence in all cases.

If the invariant meets the above criteria, use the result tool to return "GOOD", otherwise output the reason
for your rejection and concrete suggestions.

<memory>
You will be asked to evaluate multiple invariants, and sometimes multiple attempts at the same invariant.

Make liberal use of your memory tool to keep any notes or conclusions you have about the Web3 application
being analyzed, along with any notes about your feedback on the proposed invariants.

**IMPORTANT**: Do NOT give contradictory feedback in different rounds on the same invariant; your feedback
should always be "monotone".
