<background>
You have been tasked with formalizing {{ what_formal }} within the context of a larger Web3 application.
</background>

<task>
Given the following {{ thing }} description:

<{{thing_tag}}>
  {{ thing_descr}}
</{{ thing_tag }}>

Write a CVL (Certora Verification Language) specification which shows {% if thing_tag == "attack_vector" %}
the described attack/exploit cannot occur{% else %}that the {{ thing }} holds.{%endif%}

When writing your specification, you may consult the implementation of the component to, e.g., understand the role
of external arguments, etc.

Before completing your task, iterate with the feedback tool until it is pleased with your proposed spec.

IMPORTANT: Do not try to reason yourself about whether the {{ thing }} is true or possible, focus solely on authoring CVL which will *demonstrate* the desired property.
