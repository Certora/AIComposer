    1. The final statement of every rules must end be either an assert or satisfy statement. A conditional statement which itself contains satsify or assert statements is not acceptable.
    2. The CVL should be well-typed.
    3. By default, all numeric variables should be `mathint`: an arbitrary precision integer.
       a. As an exception, variables which are to be passed TO contract functions, 
          variables that hold the RESULT of a contract call, or which index into an array, should use the appropriate (u)intK type.
    4. All mathematical operations (which excludes bitvector operations) produce `mathint`. To narrow the `mathint` result of a mathematical operation to a uintK or intK type, either `require_(u)intK` or `assert_(u)intK` should be used.
    5. Every contract function implicitly receives an `env` parameter representing the calling environment, e.g., the block number, caller etc. The only exception are methods explicitly annotated as `envfree` in the methods block.
    6. Method block specifics:
       a. `internal` functions should never be marked as `envfree`
       b. expression summaries on `_.method(params)` entries *must* include an expect clause
       c. The operand of ALWAYS must be a constant
       d. Reference types in *internal* method signatures (parameters and return) must *always* include the data location.
       e. Reference types in *external* method signatures from *libraries* must also *always* include the data location.
       f. The data location on reference types in other contexts is optional.
       g. A method block entry without a specific contract identifier (e.g., `function foo() ...`) is implicitly qualified with the contract unfer verification. To refer to *any* method called `foo()`, you must use
          the `function _.foo() ...` syntax.
       h. A method block signature for a method which uses a user defined type alias must ALSO use the user defined type alias in the parameter/return types,
          *NOT* the underlying type alias.
    7. Unlike the methods block, parameter types in `preserved` blocks, signature literals, and dispatch list signatures should *not* include data locations.
    8. The contract name in `methods` block should be the contract type name, *not* the identifier bound by a `using` clause.
    9. With the exception of ghosts, values are immutable in CVL. That is, it is illegal to write `uint[] a = [1,2,3]; a[0] = 4;` Instead, values should be constrained via `require` statements.
       a. Variables declared but never bound or constrained simply take on non-deterministic values.
    10. Bitwise operations can be over-approximated and should be avoided if possible.
    11. By default, ghost functions and values are reverted along with the blockchain state at reverts. To opt out of this behavior, the ghost should be marked as `persistent`.
    12. `method` variables must be declared as rule parameters, not within the body of the rule.
    13. Quantifier bodies must *not* contain contract calls, nor `require_*` or `assert_*` casts.
    14. All CVL functions must end in a `return` statement, even if the function has no return value.
    15. Void functions in `CVL` should simply omit the returns clause. `returns void` should NOT be used.
    16. The return value of `@withrevert` calls should rarely be used, as it is undefined if the function in question reverted.
    17. method block entries which are neither marked `envfree` nor have a summary serve no purpose. All external methods declared in the target smart contract are automatically exposed to a CVL specification; the
        `methods` block is only necessary for *annotating* specific methods.
    18. Preserved blocks for an invariant I add requirements to the prestate *on top* of the invariant itself. When proving an invariant I for some contract C, the prover shows the following is true for all possible methods m in C:
        `assume I; m(); assert I`. `preserved` blocks are essentially inserted after the `assume I;` Crucially, there is NO NEED to "manually" require the invariant `I`, it is always included in the pre-state requirements.
