Evaluate the provided CVL specification against the system document,
and suggest missing safety rules. Do NOT provide the text of the suggested rules,
simply what the rule should verify.

Some notes:
1. Rules regarding immutability are generally not interesting, as an implementer can satisfy these requirements by simply using `immutable` fields.
2. Rules describing exact cryptographic correctness (e.g., only allow valid signatures) are infeasible in practice, given the over-approximation of hashing used by the certora prover.
3. Rules verifying something doesn't exist are likewise generally hard to write; in general it is hard to write a rule that says "function X does not exist"
