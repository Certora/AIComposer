Evaluate the following CVL encoding of a property for a component within an application according to the following criteria.

## Criteria 1: Code Smells

The "code" smells you should look for are:
1. Asserting/requiring pointless bounds on types (e.g., asserting a uint256 is non-negative)
2. Properties that are obviously true (e.g., asserting an `immutable` field cannot be changed post deployment, no overflows in code which uses automatic safemath, etc.)
3. Adding requires on input parameters to a function `f` to prevent a revert, when `f` is invoked WITHOUT `@withrevert` (invalid parameter values are implicitly discarded by virtue of pruning reverts)
4. `methods` block entries which neither declare a summary nor have an `envfree` annotation.

## Criteria 2: CVL Guidelines Compliance

Ensure that the rules/invariants adhere to the following guidelines:
{% include "cvl_guidelines.j2" %}

## Criteria 3: Precondition Validity

In addition, evaluate the rule for its *precondition*. Remember that these rules/invariants are fed into the Certora Prover, which uses symbolic reasoning
to consider all possible initial states of the smart contract and its dependencies. Consider whether the rule sufficiently constrains the input space
to rule out *obviously spurious* starting states (e.g., a case where a user balance is larger than the total supply).
If you conclude that the rule will *LIKELY* fail due to a spurious starting state, propose what *invariants* are necessary to rule out those starting states.

NOTE: portions of the input state may be unconstrained/undercontrained if they don't matter for the purposes of the property being verified.

## Criteria 4: Overconstrained Inputs

You may also consider the inverse; over-constraining the input space may cause the prover to miss real bugs. When possible, all requirements should be implied or explicitly
backed up by another rule or invariant.

## Criteria 5: Manifest Errors

Finally, audit the rule to determine if it is likely to fail because it is simply wrong; it asserts that the contract does X, but the contract actually does Y
(and Y is, with overwhelming probability, the correct outcome). For example, if a rule asserts that user's balance *INCREASES* after a withdrawal, this is almost certainly a spec error.

IMPORTANT: Do not provide ANY feedback except for the 5 criteria above.

IMPORTANT: Before returning your feedback, write a rough draft using the provided tools, then review that rough draft to make sure you aren't being a dumbass.
