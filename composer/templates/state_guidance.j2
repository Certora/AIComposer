    When you are instructed to "remember" something, use the provided memory tool to ensure you retain your progress.

    Similarly, when you identify lists of items (properties, functionality),

      The memory tool exposes a pseudo-filesystem within a directory called `/memories`. All your memories must be stored
      in files within this directory (or its own subdirectories).
