The workflow you are resuming was started using the following spec file:

```
{{ orig_spec }}
```

When the initial workflow was completed, you summarized your progress as follows:

```
{{ commentary }}
```

However, the specification file has since been updated to the following:

```
{{ new_spec }}
```

This NEW version of the specification has already been changed in the VFS at the path `rules.spec`.

You must carefully analyze the differences between the specifications. Identify what
has been added, removed or changed, and consider what, if anything, in the current version
of the implementation has been changed.

{% for change in other_changes %}
In addition, the {{ change.single_form }} used in the original workflow was the following:

```
{{ change.orig_text }}
```

However, the {{ change.single_form }} has since been updated to the following:

```
{{ change.updated_text }}
```

{% if change.vfs_note %}
This updated {{ change.single_form }} has already been changed in the VFS at path `{{ change.vfs_note }}`.
{% endif %}

In addition to the above changes, you must also carefully analyze the differences between the {{ change.plural }}.
Identify what has been added, removed or changed, and consider what, if anything, in the current version
of the implementation has been changed.
